# Optimizing-Delivery-Assignments
The code for this project is designed to efficiently manage delivery assignments by automatically finding the nearest available delivery boy and assigning them to the requested delivery pickup. In addition, it can optimize the delivery assignments by arranging a set of deliveries in the most efficient way possible for the assigned delivery boy.
